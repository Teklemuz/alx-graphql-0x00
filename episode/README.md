- **Query Files**: Each `.graphql` file contains a query that fetches details for a specific episode by ID.
  
  - `episode-page-1.graphql`: GraphQL query for episode with ID 1.

- **Output Files**: Each `.json` file contains the response for the respective episode ID, showing the data returned by the GraphQL query.

  - `episode-page-1-output.json`: The output of the query for episode 1.

## How to Use

To retrieve the details of a specific episode, you can use a GraphQL tool like **GraphiQL**, **Apollo Client**, or any other GraphQL client to execute the queries.

2. Navigate to the `episode` directory.
    ```bash
    cd alx-graphql-0x00/episode
    ```
3. Choose one of the `.graphql` query files (e.g., `episode-page-1.graphql`) and execute the query.
4. View the corresponding `.json` output file (e.g., `episode-page-1-output.json`) to see the details returned from the API.
